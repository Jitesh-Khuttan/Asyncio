    "#### Parallelism vs Concurrency vs Threading\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Parallelism</b> consists of performing multiple operations at the same time. Multiprocessing is a means to effect parallelism, and it entails spreading tasks over a computer’s central processing units (CPUs, or cores). Multiprocessing is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks: tightly bound for loops and mathematical computations usually fall into this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Concurrency</b> is a slightly broader term than parallelism. It suggests that multiple tasks have the ability to run in an overlapping manner. (There’s a saying that concurrency does not imply parallelism.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Threading</b> is a concurrent execution model whereby multiple threads take turns executing tasks. One process can contain multiple threads. Python has a complicated relationship with threading thanks to its GIL."

    "### The Rules of Async IO\n",
    "- The syntax async def introduces either a native coroutine or an asynchronous generator.\n",
    "- The keyword await passes function control back to the event loop. (It suspends the execution of the surrounding coroutine.) If Python encounters an await f() expression in the scope of g(), this is how await tells the event loop, “Suspend execution of g() until whatever I’m waiting on—the result of f()—is returned. In the meantime, go let something else run.”\n",
    "\n",
    "<code> \n",
    "    async def g():\n",
    "        #Pause here and come back to g() when f() is ready\n",
    "        r = await f()\n",
    "        return r\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s also a strict set of rules around when and how you can and cannot use async/await.\n",
    "- A function that you introduce with <code> async def </code> is a <b> coroutine </b>. It may use <code> await, return, or yield </code>, but all of these are optional. Declaring <code> async def noop(): pass </code> is valid.\n",
    "    1. Using await and/or return creates a <b> coroutine function </b>. To call a coroutine function, you must await it to get its results.\n",
    "    2. It is less common (and only recently legal in Python) to use <code> yield </code> in an <code> async def </code> block. This creates an <b> asynchronous generator </b>, which you iterate over with <code> async for </code>.\n",
    "    3. Anything defined with <code> async def </code> may not use <code> yield from </code>, which will raise a <b>SyntaxError</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Just like it’s a SyntaxError to use yield outside of a def function, it is a SyntaxError to use await outside of an async def coroutine. <b> <i> You can only use await in the body of coroutines. </i> </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Examples:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "async def f(x):\n",
    "    y = await z(x)   # OK - `await` and `return` allowed in coroutines\n",
    "    return y\n",
    " </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "async def g(x):\n",
    "    yield x  # OK - this is an async generator\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "async def m(x):\n",
    "    yield from gen(x)  # No - SyntaxError\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<code>\n",
    "def m(x):\n",
    "    y = await z(x)  #Still no - SyntaxError (no `async def` here)\n",
    "    return y\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when you use await f(), it’s required that f() be an object that is <b>awaitable</b>. \n",
    "Just know that an awaitable object is either:\n",
    "- another coroutine (or)\n",
    "- an object defining an .\\_\\_await\\_\\_() dunder method that returns an iterator."
